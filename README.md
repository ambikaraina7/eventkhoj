# eventkhoj

- Using Angular JS in the front-end and NodeJS in the back-end developed a responsive website hosted via AWS Beanstalk for an Entertainment Search portal that displayed a list of events searched by the user. \n
- Using AJAX and JSON technologies, parsed data from Ticketmaster, Spotify, Google Custom Search and Google Maps API, to display the artist and venue details.
- Incorporated keyword auto-complete and animation using Angular Material
- Added a feature to tweet the event details using the Twitter API and used HTML Local Storage for storing and removing Favorite events.
